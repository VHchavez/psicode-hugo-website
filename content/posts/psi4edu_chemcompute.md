## No computing resources? No Problem!

#### Psi4Education has partnered with [ChemCompute](https://chemcompute.org/) to enable you to run Psi4Education Jupyter notebook labs using FREE compute resources through ChemCompute.  You do not have to install or configure any software on your own computer. It's easy to sign up and get started.
- [Sign up for a free account](https://chemcompute.org/register/).
- In the top navigation bar, go to Psi4/Jupyter and choose Use Psi4 or JupyterHub.
- Your server will load within your web browser.
- Click on the psi4education folder, then labs, and choose the lab you want!

Instructors are encouraged to use ChemCompute in their classes. The service is completely free and you don't need to ask permission, just sign up!  We strongly encourage instructors to fill out the ChemCompute [instructor survey](https://sonoma.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6GaqVWCFvTgFTaR) to support ChemCompute in providing resources for the community.
