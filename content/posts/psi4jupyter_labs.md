#### Some of the PSI4Education labs are presented as jupyter notebooks.  Learn more about using jupyter notebooks [here](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks).

#### The following Python scripting skills are assumed as prerequisite knowledge.  Any other Python data structures or skills needed are explained within the lab.
- importing libraries
- assigning variables
- recasting data types
- slices and lists
- for loops
- logic statements
- print statements
- graphing data with matplotlib pyplot

If you need tutorials on these Python skills, we recommend [these lessons](https://molssi-education.github.io/python_scripting_cms/) from the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute](https://molssi.org/).  Completing lessons 1, 4, and 5 would help students develop all the required python prerequisite skills needed for the Psi4Education labs.
