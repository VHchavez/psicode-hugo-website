:term:`DO_SCS <DO_SCS (OMP3)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Do perform spin-component-scaled OMP3 (SCS-OMP3)? In all computation, SCS-OMP3 energy is computed automatically. However, in order to perform geometry optimizations and frequency computations with SCS-OMP3, one needs to set 'DO_SCS' to true

      * **Type**: :ref:`boolean <op_c_boolean>`
      * **Default**: false
