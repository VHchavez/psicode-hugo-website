:term:`DO_SOS <DO_SOS (OMP3)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Do perform spin-opposite-scaled OMP3 (SOS-OMP3)? In all computation, SOS-OMP3 energy is computed automatically. However, in order to perform geometry optimizations and frequency computations with SOS-OMP3, one needs to set 'DO_SOS' to true

      * **Type**: :ref:`boolean <op_c_boolean>`
      * **Default**: false
