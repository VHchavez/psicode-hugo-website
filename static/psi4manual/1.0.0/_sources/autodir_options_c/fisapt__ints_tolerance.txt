:term:`INTS_TOLERANCE <INTS_TOLERANCE (FISAPT)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Minimum absolute value below which integrals are neglected. For ISAPT, a variational collapse problem seems to occur for even rather modest values of this cutoff, when DF is used and when very close contacts occur. Therefore, we will be safe and turn it off (this does not affect performance overtly)
