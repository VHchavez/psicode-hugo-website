:term:`COUPLED_INDUCTION <COUPLED_INDUCTION (SAPT)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Whether or not to compute coupled induction, applies only to the open-shell SAPT0 code. Coupled induction is not available for ROHF, and the option is automatically false in this case. Note that when coupled induction is turned off, the Psi variables SAPT IND20,R ENERGY and SAPT EXCH-IND20,R ENERGY actually contain the **uncoupled** induction! A corresponding warning is issued in the output file.
