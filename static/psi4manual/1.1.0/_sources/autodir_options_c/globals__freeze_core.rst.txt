:term:`FREEZE_CORE <FREEZE_CORE (GLOBALS)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies how many core orbitals to freeze in correlated computations. ``TRUE`` will default to freezing the standard default number of core orbitals. For PSI, the standard number of core orbitals is the number of orbitals in the nearest previous noble gas atom. More precise control over the number of frozen orbitals can be attained by using the keywords :term:`NUM_FROZEN_DOCC <NUM_FROZEN_DOCC (GLOBALS)>` (gives the total number of orbitals to freeze, program picks the lowest-energy orbitals) or :term:`FROZEN_DOCC <FROZEN_DOCC (GLOBALS)>` (gives the number of orbitals to freeze per irreducible representation)

      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: FALSE, TRUE
      * **Default**: FALSE
