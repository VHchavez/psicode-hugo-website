:term:`FREEZE_CORE <FREEZE_CORE (GLOBALS)>`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      Specifies how many core orbitals to freeze in correlated computations. ``TRUE`` will default to freezing the standard default number of core orbitals. For heavier elements, there can be some ambiguity in how many core orbitals to freeze; in such cases, ``SMALL`` picks the most conservative standard setting (freezes fewer orbitals), and ``LARGE`` picks the least conservative standard setting (freezes more orbitals). More precise control over the number of frozen orbitals can be attained by using the keywords :term:`NUM_FROZEN_DOCC <NUM_FROZEN_DOCC (GLOBALS)>` (gives the total number of orbitals to freeze, program picks the lowest-energy orbitals) or :term:`FROZEN_DOCC <FROZEN_DOCC (GLOBALS)>` (gives the number of orbitals to freeze per irreducible representation)
