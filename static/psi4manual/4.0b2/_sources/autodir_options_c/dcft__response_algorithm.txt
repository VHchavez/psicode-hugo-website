:term:`RESPONSE_ALGORITHM <RESPONSE_ALGORITHM (DCFT)>`
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

      The algorithm to use for the solution of the response equations for the analytic gradients and properties. Two-step algorithm is generally more efficient than simultaneous and is used by default
