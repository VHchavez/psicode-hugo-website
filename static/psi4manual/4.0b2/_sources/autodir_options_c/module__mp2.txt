MP2
===

Performs second order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) computations. This code can compute RHF/ROHF/UHF energies, and RHF gradient/property computations. However, given the small errors introduced, we recommend using the new density fitted MP2 codes instead, which are much more efficient.
